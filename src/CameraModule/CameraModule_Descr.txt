CameraModule Description

The camera module is an event generator. It will with a set
time interval take pictures, analyze them and generate events that reflect what is seen in the picture.

Possible issues
---------------------------------------------------
* From the client perspective, if no events are received from
  the camera module, then how do they analyze the situation?

  - Create events to cover any interesting situation. Clients
    must handle situations where the camera can not clearly
    express the situation with events. E.g. when turning at
    a crossing.

Commands provided by CameraModule
---------------------------------------------------
* TakePicture
  Shall transmit, or dump to file, the picture that is seen
  by the camera when the command is issued.

* <TBD>

* <TBD>


Generated Events
---------------------------------------------------
* POSITION_ERROR_EVENT
  A picture has been analyzed and a line deviation from the
  desired position has been calculated. This deviation is
  provided with the event.

* MISALIGNED_TO_LINE_EVENT
  <TBD: Decide about the existence of this event>
  A picture has been analyzed and a line has been identified
  and the Apmaskin has an improper alignment with the line.
  The Apmaskin's attitude towards the line, in line k-value,
  and its straightahead-distance to the line will be provided
  with the event.

* INTERSECTION_DETECTED_EVENT
  A picture has been analyzed and an intersection on a line
  has been discovered. The direction(s) of the intersection
  is provided with the event.

* NUMBER_FOUND_EVENT
  A picture has been analyzed and a number has been
  identified. The number is provided with the event.


Functionality
---------------------------------------------------
The CameraModule will take pictures repeatedly with a
time interval specified by CAMERAMODULE_PICTURE_TIME_INTERVAL.
Each picture will be analyzed by CameraModule to determine
what is seen in the picture.

CameraModule will try to identify the following patterns in
a picture:

* Line
  If a line is seen in the picture and the Apmaskin is
  aligned with the line a POSITION_ERROR_EVENT will be
  generated. If the Apmaskin is not aligned with the line a
  MISALIGNED_TO_LINE_EVENT will be generated.
